## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in **Mimesweeper**, don't hesitate to _report them_.

1. Create an [Issue](https://github.com/gcko/mimesweeper/issues).
2. Describe the vulnerability.

   If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please create a PR or summarize it in your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
